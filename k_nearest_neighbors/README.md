# K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier with Decision Boundary Animation

## Project Description

In this project, we tackle the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which is a simple yet robust classification technique. After generating a synthetic dataset, we apply the algorithm, and visualize the evolution of decision boundaries as the number of neighbors (`k`) changes. Additionally, we perform cross-validated parameter tuning through a grid search to determine the optimal number of neighbors, thereby enhancing the model's performance.

## Steps and Methods

1. **Data Generation**:
   - Using `make_blobs` from the `sklearn.datasets` module, we create a synthetic dataset comprising three distinct clusters. This dataset provides well-separated classes, making it ideal for demonstrating the KNN algorithm.

2. **Data Splitting**:
   - We split the dataset into training and test sets leveraging `train_test_split` so we can evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

3. **Parameter Tuning**:
   - To ascertain the optimal number of neighbors, we employ `GridSearchCV` from the `sklearn.model_selection` module. This involves:
     - **Cross-Validation**: A technique to assess the generalizability of the model by partitioning the training data into multiple folds. The model is trained on several folds and validated on the remaining folds, ensuring a comprehensive performance evaluation.
     - **Grid Search**: An exhaustive search over a predefined parameter grid to identify the best hyperparameters. In this scenario, we vary the number of neighbors (`k`) from 1 to 30 and use cross-validation to select the optimal value.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Leveraging the optimal `k` identified through grid search, we train the KNN classifier on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test set. Performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are utilized.

5. **Visualization**:
   - We generate an animation to visualize the evolution of decision boundaries as `k` increases from 1 to 30. This animation aids in understanding the influence of the number of neighbors on the classifier's decision-making process.

## Animation Insights

- **Initial Stages (Low k)**:
  - With a small number of neighbors (e.g., `k=1`), the decision boundaries are highly flexible and closely follow the training data. This often leads to overfitting, where the model captures noise in the data, resulting in highly irregular decision boundaries.
  
- **Middle Stages (Moderate k)**:
  - As `k` increases, the decision boundaries become smoother and more generalized. This balance helps achieve better performance on unseen data, as the model captures the underlying patterns in the data without being overly sensitive to noise.
  
- **Later Stages (High k)**:
  - With a large number of neighbors (e.g., `k=30`), the decision boundaries become exc
  essively smooth, leading to underfitting. The model may become too simplistic to capture the complexity of the data, resulting in suboptimal performance.

## Conclusions

1. **Optimal k**:
   - Through cross-validation and grid search, we identified the optimal number of neighbors (`k`) that balances bias and variance, achieving the best performance on the test set.

2. **Cross-Validation and Grid Search**:
   - These techniques are critical for parameter tuning, providing a systematic approach to identifying the best hyperparameters and enhancing the model's generalization capability.

3. **Impact of k on Decision Boundaries**:
   - The animation effectively demonstrates how the number of neighbors influences the decision boundaries. It highlights the trade-off between overfitting and underfitting, emphasizing the importance of selecting an appropriate `k`.

This project showcases the practical application of KNN, parameter tuning, and visualization techniques, offering valuable insights into the behavior of the algorithm and its performance optimization. The animated decision boundaries provide a clear, intuitive understanding of how the KNN classifier adapts to changes in `k`, making it a valuable addition to a data science portfolio.
